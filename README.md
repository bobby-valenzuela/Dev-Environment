# Quick Reference

Quick references for key-bindings I commonly use.

<br />

## General copy/paste/searching within this setup
---
<br />

__Tmux search__
- `<bind-key> + [` - Enter copy mode 
  - `/` - Start search
  - Enter search term and then `<Enter>` (then use `n/N` to search throughout matches - search starts at top of page, use `N` to search backwards)
  - End search: `q`

<br />

__tmux copy/paste [MAIN]__  _(copy to tmux buffer and clipboard)_
- Enter copy mode: `<bind-key>  [`
- Use arrows to find text to start to copy from 
-Start Selection: `v`
- Copy: `y`
- Paste (from tmux buffer): `<bind-key> + ]`
- Paste (from system clipboard): `Ctrl+Shift+V`

<br />

__Neovim and Cli quick copy commands__
- Tmux quick copy (from cli to system clipboard): `Mouse select + y (while selecting)`
- Neovim copy (clipboard) => `Select (mouse/v) + y`

<br />

<br />

## TMUX

- Enable TMUX plugins by install TPM: `https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm`
- Reload config file: `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`
- Reload TMUX environment: `Ctrl+I`  _For re-loading Theme for example_

<br />

---
### Sessions
Open tmux as a named session: `tmux new -s <name>`  
To detach a tmux session: `Ctrl+B+D`  
View tmux sessions (from cli): `tmux ls`  
Re-attach to session (from cli): `tmux attach -t 0`  
Rename tmux sessions (from cli): `tmux rename-sesssion -t 0 <name>`  
Killing tmux sessions (from cli): `tmux kill-sesssion -t 0 <name>` 
__Where ‘0’ is your session id/name__

<br />

---
### Windows
Rename Window: `Ctrl+B+,`  
Create new Window: `Ctrl+B+C`  
Show all Windows: `Ctrl+B+S`  
Show all Windows (with preview): `Ctrl+B+w` _Enter to select_  
Switch between windows: `Ctrl+B+<number>`  
Close Window: `exit`

<br />

---
### Panes
Split Windows Vertically: `Ctrl+B+%`  (with my conf I use `|` instead of `%`)  
Split Windows Horizontally: `Ctrl+B+"`  (w/66ith my conf I use `_` instead of `"`)  
Navigate subwindows (panes): c  
Show pane numbers: `Ctrl+B+Q`  
Move current pane left: `Ctrl+B+{`  
Move current pane right: `Ctrl+B+}`  
Zoom in/out to make pane full screen: `Ctrl+B+Z`
Close pane: `exit` or `Ctrl+B+Z`

<br />

## Vim
There are loads of good vim cheat sheets out there and this isn't a substitution, but rather a list of common/handy ones I've found to be efficient on my workflow.

`o`    - Reverse order while continuing to select  
`/<term>` - While in visual mode, select lines based on RegEx  
`C-v` - enter visual block mode. Once text is selected enter insert mode (`a/A`,`i/I`,`c/C`,`p/P`,`o/O` etc) and make changes. They will appear on the first line, but once you hit Esc those changes will be made to all selected lines.  
`gs{char}` - Global surround. Example: Select text then `gs"`  
`viw` - selects just the word.  
`vaw` - selects the word plus any surrounding whitespace.  

<br />

__Finding Multiple Occurrences__  
1. Select text (in visual mode)
2. `*` to highlight all occurences (begins at next occurence)
3. `#` to highlight all occurences (begins at previus occurence)
4. `n/N` to select next/previous occurences
5. `v` again to select the highlighted occurence

<br />

#### Continguous Lines of text (paragraph)
`yap` - Yank with newlines  
`yip` - Yank without newlines  
`cap` - Change with newlines  
`cip` - Change without newlines  
`dap` - Delete with newlines  
`dip` - Delete without newlines  

<br />

---
### RegEx && Searching
`\r`                - This represents newline  
`%s/(foo)/\1\r`     - Replaces matches with itself followed by a newline   
`s///g` - When text is selected you can use a replace (without the %) to replace text within the selected range  
`s/\VTEXTOMATCH/REPLACEWITHTHIS/` - The `\V` (very no magic mode treats all characters literaly except the `\`  
`s/\v\w+/` - The `\v` (very magic mode treats most special cahrs as special - as in regular regex    

<br />

---  
### Copy/Pasting
`:reg`/`=`    - View registers (vim/lazyvim)  
`0p`     - Paste from 0 register   
`C-r0`  - Paste from 0 register into vim command line. (Useful for pasting into a search regex)  
`C-rw`  - Copy whatever word is under cursot and paste into vim command line. (Useful for pasting into a search regex)  
`"_dd`  - Delete line and yank to black hole register (keeps registers the same).  
`ayy` - Yank line to "a" register (overwriting register a).  
`Ayy` - Yank line to "a" register (appending to register a)  
`d` or `dd` - Cuts (Deletes and yanks)  
`<leader> p` - View Yank history (via yanky) [Zazyvim]  

<br />

_Note: '^J' in a register will be changed to a newline when pasting._

<br />

---  
### Editing
`ciw` - Change inner word (replace)
`xp`    - swap two adjacent letters (move letter cursor one place to the right)  
`J`     - Merge lines: Apend line below to the end of the current line.  
`cc` - change entire line.  
`~` - Change casing of selected text/character under cursor.  
`g~w` - change case of word (until whitespace)  
`g~~` - change case of entire line  
`dt/<searchterm>` - Delete text up until search term  
`<<`/`>>` - Indent code left/right  
`==`/`=` - Auto indent code (`==` for one line and `=` for multiple lines)  
`:sort`/`:sort!` - When lines are selected, this will sort in ASC/DESC order respectively.  
`read !<shell_command>` - Paste shell output into buffer.  
`u` Selected text to lower case  
`U` Selected text to upper case  
`:sort`  Sort all lines  
`:sort!` Sort all lines in reverse  
`:sort u` Sort all lines and remove duplicates  

<br />


---
### Numbers
`C-a`    - Increment Highlighted Numbers  
`gC-a`   - Increment Highlight Numbers in sequence (each matched item will increment one more than previous match).  
`C-x`    - Decrement Highlighted Numbers  
`gC-x`   - Decrement Highlight Numbers in sequence (each matched item will increment one more than previous match).

<br />

---  
### Indenting
`=` - Auto-Indenting (based on rules - works on selected text as well)  
`=ap` -  Auto-Indent Paragraph  
`<` - Indent Left  
`>` - Indent Right  

<br />

---  
### Macros
`q<letter>` - start recording a macro  
`q` - stop recording a macro  
`@<letter>` - execute macro (once)  
`<number>@<letter>` - To execute the macro <number> times  
`:3,9 normal @b` - Run macro "b" on lines 3-9.  
`reg <macro_letter>` - View register (holds macros as well - note '[^' represents the Esc key)  

__Best Practices when recording macros__
- Once recording has started, type `0` to begin at the beginning of the line.
- Once done with commands, type 'j' before you finish recording to ensure ending on the next line (in case this macro runs multiple times).

<br />

---
### Commenting/Uncommenting  
__Uncommenting__
- Put your cursor on the first comment character (like #), and enter Visual-Block mode (Ctrl+b for me)
- Go down until the last commented line and press `x`  

<br />

__Commenting__

_Option 1_
- Enter Visual-Block mode (Ctrl+b for me) then enter `:s/^/#/`  

_Option 2_
- Enter Visual-Block mode (Ctrl+b for me)
- Go down until last line and press `I`, then press `#` (or other comment character), then `Esc`.

<br />

Note: `C-` should be taken to mean `Ctrl+`. All other keys are to be entered in succession (not simultaneously).
