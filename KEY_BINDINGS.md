### Moving  

<br />

_Moving along file_

_Markers_  
`:marks` - View all markers  
`:cc 22` - View the 22nd quickfix item    
`'` - View all markers w/explanations [ðŸ”Œ]

`:delm!`  - vim clear all marks (or specific ranges like `:delm a-zA-Z0-9`)  
`''`	- Move to previous marker position  (thats two single quotes in succession, not a single double quote)  
Note: Lowercase markers are local to a file and uppercase markers are global across all files. Meaning you can re-use `a` for different places in different files but `A` only refers to one place in a single file.  

<br />


---
### Searching  
`/` - Search (grep): type text and enter then `n/N` to iterate through matches

`cn`/`cp` - Next/Previous item in quickfix list. Mapped to `F11`/`F12`.  

<br />

_RegEx_  
`\r`                - This represents newline  
`%s/(foo)/\1\r`     - Replaces matches with itself followed by a newline   
`s/old/new/g` - When text is selected you can use a replace (without the %) to replace text within the selected range (use `gc` to replace with confirmation first)    
`s/\VTEXTOMATCH/REPLACEWITHTHIS/` - The `\V` (very no magic mode treats all characters literaly except the `\`  
`s/\v\w+/` - The `\v` (very magic mode treats most special cahrs as special - as in regular regex    
`noh` - "No Highlighting" - remove highlited matches  
`vim /function/ **/*.pl` - Grep all matches of `function` in every '.pl. file in current dir (recursively). Then `:cope` to create a QuickFix list  
`vim /\Vfunction/ /home/ubuntu/**/*.pl` - Grep all matches of `function` in every '.pl. file in current dir (recursively). Then `:cope` to create a QuickFix list  
`g&` - Apply previous replace action to the entire file  

<br />

__Finding Multiple Occurrences__  
1. Select text (in visual mode)
2. `#` to highlight all occurences (can use `*` but that begins at next occurence)
3. `n/N` to select next/previous occurences
4. `v` again to select the highlighted occurence

<br />


__Change multiple instances without multi-cursor__  
1. Select text to change  
2. `#` to highlight all matches (selects next match)
3. Make sure you're in normal mode    
4. `cgn` - change globally (when done changing, press `Esc` to exit insert mode)  
5.  `.` to change every subsequent match.  

_(Can also use dgn to delete multiple references)_

### Macros and automation
`q<letter>` - start recording a macro  
`q` - stop recording a macro  
`@<letter>` - execute macro (once)  
`@@` - Rerun the last ran macro  
`<number>@<letter>` - To execute the macro <number> times  
`:3,9 normal @b` - Run macro "b" on lines 3-9.  
`reg <macro_letter>` - View register (holds macros as well - note '[^' represents the Esc key)  
`@:` - re-run last vim command  
`.` - re-run last command in normal mode  

<br /> 

__Best Practices when recording macros__
- Once recording has started, type `0` to begin at the beginning of the line.
- Once done with commands, type 'j' before you finish recording to ensure ending on the next line (in case this macro runs multiple times).

<br />

---

__Uncommenting__
- Put your cursor on the first comment character (like #), and enter Visual-Block mode (Ctrl+b for me)
- Go down until the last commented line and press `x`  

<br />

__Commenting__

_Option 1_
- Enter Visual-Block mode (Ctrl+b for me) then enter `:s/^/#/`  

_Option 2_
- Enter Visual-Block mode (Ctrl+b for me)
- Go down until last line and press `I`, then press `#` (or other comment character), then `Esc`.

<br />

Note: `C-` should be taken to mean `Ctrl+`. All other keys are to be entered in succession (not simultaneously).
